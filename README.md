# spotlight
pre-production social media platform

##### spotlight allows up and coming actors to apply to films through an online submission and get their following involved to help them secure the role. Once the pre-production process starts, the movies studio will create a conversation around the movie and engage with fandom sooner than ever before. With spotlight you will be able to deliver a movie that takes into account fan apinions.

### Tech stack
- PSQL
- Django
- Python3
- Node.js
- React.js
- Redux


### Why?
#### Indie production studios have a hard time creating engagement with fans towards their film release. Spotlight creates a conversation sorrounding the movie starting with getting the fans opinions on casting.
#### Studions aslo spend hundreds of thausands of dollars and atleast 1-2 years producin and editing films that sometimes don't get viewed. Imagine if during this time they could engage and grow their future fans. 


### How?
#### A production studion can post a highlevel descrition of the project on the platform. Users can submit video castings for the opportunity and also get to rate other people that applied for casting. This system will incentivize users to invite their friends to increase their votes bringing a lot of attention to the movie even before cast is chosen. The process can be expanded past casting into writing or music for the feature.
